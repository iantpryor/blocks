###About rain
rain is an animation in javascript that resembles rain with lightning.  The rain is recycled in a loop, so don't worry about wasting water.

The groud in rain is created using black squares and moves with keyboard control.  The ground has memory of itself for up to 1 screen length, so you can back track and see the same terrain.

The lightning in rain is created using timing events and flags to flash the background to white every 1-7 seconds at random.
